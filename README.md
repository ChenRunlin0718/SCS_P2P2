Statistical Case Studies: Project_2_part_2


## Tasks: 

1.How does peak daily demand depend on temperature?

2.How well does the model fit the historic data?

3.How could the maximum annual demand have varied in the 2013-14 winter season if different weather conditions had occurred? 
 
4.What would be the limitations in using your model to generate traces of future peak demand over a 5-10 year timescale?
